    <h1>All-HTML</h1>
    <p>With the purpose of gaining a familiarity with HTML, the requirements of this assignment were to create 3 web pages using HTML in a creative and interactive way.</p>
    <h2>Stairs</h2>
    <img src="./images/stairs.png">
    <p>This is the first of the three webpages that I created. My goal was to create an image using an HTML element, the element I used for this page being the "slider," that invites the user to interact with it in an unconven-tional way. By filling up the page with sliders and then changing the settings of individual sliders, I created the image of "stairs." By clicking and dragging on each of these sliders, the user can change the image and create whatever they would like to create. I included the text "just some stairs" at the top of the webpage because I did feel that this concept was quite mundane in a way. It really is just some stairs, but I also find it interesting that even though they are just stairs they invite the user to think about HTML elements and how they can be used in unique ways.</p>
    <h2>Color Palette Helper</h2>

    <p>This is the second website I created for this project. The initial idea behind "Color Palette Helper" is to give artists inspiration when they need a color palette, but I've found that while it could be useful for that purpose, the whole webpage just challenges the user to think solely about color, the emotions evoked by some colors, and the relationships between certain colors.</p>

    <p>When I first started ideating for this project, I found that I really wanted to do something with the color selector element. My initial idea was to allow the user to create an image by changing the colors of each color selector, but I had already created an image in my "stairs" webpage; I challenged myself to come up with how I could use the color selecter in another engaging way. As I was messing around with the color selector, I found myself trying to match the color of the items around me. Thats how I had the idea to create a webpage that poses questions that evoke the response of a certain color, and then placing the color selector element next to these questions which allow the user to choose any color on the spectrum.</p>
    <h2>The Magic Rock</h2>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/adlib.png">
    <figcaption>This is how the webpage looks when you first arrive.</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    <p>This is the final webpage I created for this project. This page is inspired by ad-libs where the user fills in the blanks to reveal a story. The story I wrote is called "The Magic Rock." The story is kind of silly because I wanted this page to be humorous and fun. When all of the blanks are filled in, the user highlights the text on the page and the story is revealed.</p>

    <figcaption>This is the webpage after I filled in all of the blanks.</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    <p>To make this webpage I used the text input element and one time input element. Each text input element has placeholder text such as "adjective" or "verb" so the user knows what kind of words to use to make sense with the story. This was pretty straight forward, a typical ad-lib. The part that I had to think outside of the box for was the mechanic of hiding the text and only revealing it once all of the blanks are filled in. After a bit of brainstorming, I realized that if the text is the same color as the background, it will basically be invisible unless highlighted by the cursor. So, I made both the background and text of the story white, and then included the text: "Highlight this page after filling in blanks to reveal your story!" at the end of the story to invite the user to do so.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was quite a challenge to create engaging webpages using only HTML and I really had to bend my perception of HTML elements and the way that they are typically used. Through this project, I learned how to use HTML more efficiently and how to use code in an outside-of-the-box kind of way.</p>
